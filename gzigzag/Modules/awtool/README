A(ssociative) writing tool -demo
--------------------------------
Usage:
- create new notes by dragging mouse and keeping
  mouse1-key pressed
- drag and drop notes created before
- resize note by ctrl-mouse1
- link notes by attaching cursors (click mouse1 / shift-mouse1
  on a note) to a pair of notes and pressing 'l' (uncapitalized 'L')
- change metrics by pressing 'm' (currently 3 possibilities)
- get rid of the grid by 'g'
- change focus (click mouse3-button)
- change origo (click shift-mouse3)
- chance to/from nile mode by 'alt-n'

To start:
- create new action 'Awtool.TESTWIN' in zz-system
- use it to invoke awtool

About the view:
- Real view (rendered part) is mutable
- Virtual view is fixed, all objects' places
  are based on virtual view coordinates (-1.0<x,y<1.0),
  These in turn correspond with some pixel-coordinates.
- Origo (o) is related to Virtual view
- Focus (f) is related to Real view

Misc:
Special dimensions. Awtool uses its own system-dimension 
'd.awtool', which stores the state of the applitude. So, 
if you quit awtool and start it newly with datacursor pointing 
to the same cell, you should end up with the old working-view 
(layer or category of notes).
