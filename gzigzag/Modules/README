Modules
=======

This directory contains various modules that depend on things
we don't want the main Java code to depend so that compilation 
remains reasonably simple. 

So the rule is: the Java code in the main package MAY NOT REFER TO
THESE CLASSES EXPLICITLY. Referrals are to happen through Class.forName()
with the name obtained through the structure. All code in the main package
should work without these modules.

Currently, the modules are

mbox/		-- convert an mbox into a String stream and ZZCell structure.
applet/		-- zigzag within the browser ! Actually this isn't a module,
		   in a sense that ZZApplet doesn't conform to ZZModule 
	 	   interface. ZZApplet is located here because it requires
		   XML module to work.
