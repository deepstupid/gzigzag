Nile Is a Literary Editor ;)
=========================

Hierarchical text structure
Key-based simple selections *and* motions of the selected text
word-by-word, sentence-by-sentence.

Parallel markup stream, indicating the paragraphs and sectioning.
Additionally, spaceparts that use this markup to imply various
kinds of trees.

With firstcap after any two spaces.

Operations: (not yet implemented - this is a list of ideas)
    Fundamental (required to create text that uses all features)
	- insertion
	- backspace, going over paragraph boundaries
	- enter, split / start new paragraph
	- cursor motion
	- adjust paragraph level (P .. H1)
	    (XXX mustn't take too much keyspace if we want e.g. ULs later)

    Rearrangement (the real thing)
	- selecting groups by word / sentence / paragraph using keyboard, 
	  hopping those bits over the corresponding bits
	- easily moving to outline view, outline hop
	- splitting into implied fragments and hopping those as cells
	- cutting into textcloud -style bits that float around paragraphs

    Hyperconnections
	- paragraph comments for outline
	- sideways connected documents, using nile-anchor dimension between
	  cells very simply. Like paralleltextview
	
    Versioning & transcluding
	- need cellular versioning mechanisms
	- side-by-side view with beams
	    (the nile delta view ;)
	- see all current documents that transclude given area

Word's selection by words by default needs to be mentioned.
