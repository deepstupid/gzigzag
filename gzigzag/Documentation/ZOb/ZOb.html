<h3>Gentle introduction</h3>

<p>The ZOb system is a way to have data structures in the ZigZag-space, like
objects in an object oriented language. The data structures are made up of
members and values associated with them.</p>

<img src="testzob.png" border=2><br clear="all">

<p>This is a picture of a ZOb. It shows two members and their values. In this
ZOb, the data members are connected to each other on <tt>d.user-2</tt> and to
the ZOb on <tt>d.user-1</tt>.</p>

<img src="zobtype.png" border=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="javazob.png" border=2><br clear="all">

<p>On <tt>d.zob-type</tt>, the ZOb's masterclone is connected to a Clasm function
that takes two parameters: <tt>instance</tt> and <tt>member</tt>. The function
returns values for members from the given instance. This specific kind of ZOb that
uses <tt>d.user-1</tt> and <tt>d.user-2</tt> is called a JavaZOb.</p>

<img src="printzob.png" border=2><br clear="all">

<p>Using JavaZObs from Java code is simple. First you have to make a
Clasm function such as the one in the picture above. This calls the
function <tt>print zob</tt> with a clone of your zob as the parameter.
When the function is executed, the source code of a Java class will be printed
out on the console. You have to copy the output into a file with the correct filename
(in this case it would be <tt>testPrintZOb.java</tt>) in the
<tt>src/gzigzag/src/impl/zob/</tt> folder.</p>
This class has members with the same names as the members in the ZOb.
The constructor takes one parameter, which is the cell of the ZOb instance.

<h3>Design problems:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Inheriting ZObs - perhaps the headcell on <tt>d.zob-type</tt> could be a clone of
another ZOb (an (empty) instance perhaps).</li><br>

Actually, it might be reasonable to associate a type with ZOb members<br>
in the structure, both for documentation and this. I'd like to know<br>
that some parameter is a font, and another an int.<br>

How to accomplish that - must look into how to associate java objects
with Cells or something.</li><br>
</ul>

<h3>To do:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use <tt>d.javaname</tt> to give a ZOb's members names that Java can use, in
case somebody wants to use "non-Java-usable" or duplicate membernames on the
GZigZag side. This goes in the Clasm-function that prints out ZObs.</li><br>
</ul>
