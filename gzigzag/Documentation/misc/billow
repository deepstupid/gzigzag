I suggest:
 up and down move the position of the billow,
 right and left affect its size,
 right and left with right button down enlarges and reduces
  the font sizes in the billow,
 while left button at any time marks the text, as usual.

Motto: Key assignments are the most changeable aspects--
 they hardly affect the virtuality.  Mapping of function that
 seems consistent with usual functions is a constraint.

Best, Ted
