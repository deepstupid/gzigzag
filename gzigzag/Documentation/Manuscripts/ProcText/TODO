Priorities:

- complicated, realistic example images of proctext and conn
    - proctext in gzz
    - 1D textured connectors with direct connections between elliptical
      and rectangular and hexagonal nodes

- article text: all points there? All objections answered?
- choose approach for proctext. So many possible viewpoints :(
- describe properly WHY conns is important:
    - layout with constraints
    - fit more information
    ...
    - aivan eri lähtökohdat

- references? 
    -blending

- figures
    - 3D texture pipeline
    - conns: depth &c
