  abstract =     "Real-time graphics hardware is becoming programmable,
                 but this programmable hardware is complex and difficult
                 to use given current APIs. Higher-level abstractions
                 would both increase programmer productivity and make
                 programs more portable. However, it is challenging to
                 raise the abstraction level while still providing high
                 performance. We have developed a real-time procedural
                 shading language system designed to achieve this goal
                 Our system is organized around multiple computation
                 frequencies. For example, computations may be
                 associated with vertices or with fragments/pixels. Our
                 system's shading language provides a unified interface
                 that allows a single procedure to include operations
                 from more than one computation frequency. Internally,
                 our system virtualizes limited hardware resources to
                 allow for arbitrarily-complex computations. We map
                 operations to graphics hardware if possible, or to the
                 host CPU as a last resort. This mapping is performed by
                 compiler back-end modules associated with each
                 computation frequency. Our system can map vertex
                 operations to either programmable vertex hardware or to
                 the host CPU, and can map fragment operations to either
                 programmable fragment hardware or to multipass OpenGL.
                 By carefully designing all the components of the
                 system, we are able to generate highly-optimized code.
                 We demonstrate our system running in real-time on a
                 variety of hardware.",
