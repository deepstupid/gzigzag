\abstract

We describe the issues faced in designing an effective user interface
to the Internet RFCs,
a set of
highly technical documents, whose contents are deeply interconnected.
The desired user interface is such that HTML cannot be used
as descriptive markup, only presentational markup.
To allow flexibility with respect to visualizations, a different, descriptive
markup system for the hyperstructure must be used.
Such a system enables advanced focus+context
visualizations.
We also discuss
our work-in-progress implementation on top of GZigZag.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

We use the Network Working Group's Request for Comments
(RFC) document series~\cite{rfc-intro,rfc-index} as an example 
of a large set of interrelated documents.
We argue that it would be easier to browse these documents
using an interface that would
be able to show the actual 
underlying hyperstructure of the documents
by showing the ``neighbouring'' pieces of documents simultaneously,
i.e.~a focus+context\cite{fc-large-trees,fc-fisheye,fc-star} interface.

HTML\cite{html-spec} is often considered to be descriptive markup language,
since instead of describing the appearance of the various elements,
it describes their functions, such as {\tt title}.
However, for representing the intertextual structure of the RFCs,
HTML as it is today implemented quickly becomes a mere presentational tool.
We discuss what would be needed of a descriptive markup language
for this task.


% Two-directional and multi-directional links are mentioned in several
% contexts in the hypertext literature\cite{XXX,XXX}, but 
% there are relatively few implementations and almost none that are
% in production use.

% Focus+context methods!!! \cite{XXX}
% \tjl{Please help with intro... Needs lots of text \& refs}

% {\bf Needing to "go" somewhere to know whether it is relevant is not
% acceptable!} \cite{XXX}

% \nakki{Viitteet mm. Tediin.}

% We feel that scalability of hypertextual user interfaces to large
% amounts of data is an important consideration that has
% not been paid enough attention to in the literature.
% Any%
% \nakki{References for this?}\ajk{Ei tunnu lˆytyv‰n.}%
% \tjl{Ent‰s n‰in? Liian arroganttia?}
% interface is sufficient when one is
% dealing with a small amount of information.  For example, one can
% easily handle a two-page document regardless of how it is
% presented---on paper, as a text file or as hypertext\ajk{should this
%   be ``a hypertext''?}.  However, many interfaces that work well with
% small amount of data---which is a common laboratory situation---do not work
% so well when presented with a large dataset, such as a document
% that is several thousand pages long or, more to the point, consists of
% \rr{``More to the point''? Why do we say something that has little point?
%     This sounds like ``Take this example --- no, this is not good, take
%     {\em that one} instead.''}
% dozens of volumes each thousands of pages long.  In other words, those
% interfaces do not scale well.



In the following sections, we first introduce the RFC genre
and discuss how the HTML document model is insufficient for this class
of documents. 
Then we present our view of what a good interface and hyperstructure
for the RFCs would be like and discuss our work-in-progress 
implementation on GZigZag.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{THE INTERNET RFCS}

The
RFC series forms a critical basis for the Internet standardization
effort: 
most technical standards which the
Internet is based on
have been published 
in the last twenty years as RFCs (Requests For Comments).
A history of the RFC series can be found
in~\cite{rfc-refguide} and in~\cite{thirty-years-of-rfc}.

% The RFC series, founded in 1969, was originally a series of
% working notes circulated among the early designers of the ARPANET,
% which later became the Internet.  Many of the earlier debates are
% still available in the RFC archives.  As the services of ARPANET grew
% and discussions could be held online via email and public discussion
% services, the RFC series became a publishing medium for results of
% those discussions.  

RFCs are divided into \emph{Standards Track}\/ RFCs and other
types, such as \emph{Informational}\cite{rfc-authoring,not-all-rfcs-are-standards}.  
A Standards Track
RFC is either an \emph{Internet Standard} or on its way to become
one\cite{ietf-standardization}.  
For example, the Internet email protocols and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) are 
documented in Standards Track RFCs (see for example~\cite{rfc822}).
Most RFCs are also of a highly technical 
nature~\cite{rfc-intro}.  
%In essence, Standards Track RFCs document Internet's standard
%protocols in various stages of maturity~\cite{ietf-standardization}.

% Figure~\ref{fig-rfc-update} contains an example of an RFC that updates
% another RFC.

\rr{Kata sanoi, ett‰ seuraavassa osassa ihmetytt‰‰, miksi RFC:t sitten eiv‰t
    ole hypertekstimuodossa alunperinkin. T‰ss‰ pit‰isi selitt‰‰, ett‰ niiden
    std-format on ASCII, miksi se on niin, ja tehd‰ viittaus. Selitt‰ess‰
    voisi ehk‰ viitata Tedin ``markup considered harmful''-juttuun, jotta
    saadaan lis‰‰ Tediviittauksia :*)}
\rr{Voisi t‰ss‰ vaiheessa sanoa, ett‰ olemme kiinnostuneita standardien
    nykytilan esitt‰misest‰, ja obsolete RFC:t eiv‰t siksi juuri kiinnosta
    meit‰.}

The actual RFC documents are rather long.  
For example, the RFCs used in the Figures of this article, 
1034, 2181 and 2308, which discuss the DNS (Domain Name System) 
are
17000, 5800 and 5900 words long, respectively --- and these three
are not the only ones concerning DNS.

The RFC series is considered to be an archival series:
once issued, an RFC is never modified~\cite{rfc-intro}.  Thus, when a
protocol documented in an RFC needs to be modified for whatever
reasons, a new RFC is issued.  Such an RFC either \emph{obsoletes} or 
\emph{updates} the RFC it is based on~\cite{rfc-authoring}.
If an RFC has been obsoleted, it is generally only interesting for
historical reasons. 
On the other hand, an RFC that has been updated retains its importance;
the updates usually only slightly change the content.
Among the abovementioned RFCs 1034, 2181 and 2303, the two latter
RFCs update the original 1034 by various amendments relating
to security, among other things.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{HTMLIFYING THE RFCS}

An HTML version of the RFCs is available at \cite{rfc-index-faqs}.
Figure \ref{fig-example-current}
shows the index entry and fragments of the HTML version of
RFC 1034.
The index entry shows which RFCs this RFC obsoletes as well
as which RFCs update it. 
The text of the RFC itself has not been modified (see below),
and therefore the RFC itself only shows its relationship with RFCs that came
before it.

% Direct references to complete
% RFCs are shown as hyperlinks.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\vbox{
a) \\ \includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{HTML-RFC-index.ps} \\
b) \\ \includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{HTML-RFC.ps}
}
\caption{a)The index entry at \cite{rfc-index-faqs} for RFC 1034
b) Fragments of the HTML version of RFC 1034 from \cite{rfc-index-faqs}.
\label{fig-example-current}}
\end{figure}

On the RFC 1034 HTML page, no reference is made to the RFCs that
have later updated that RFC.
When reading the the RFC, there is no way of knowing directly
whether some other RFC has updated the content of a given paragraph,
since none of the updated paragraph
contain links to the updating RFCs.
This can be a problem for the reader, since
the 
longest and most important RFCs 
naturally become the most heavily updated ones with time and the
updates can be of a crucial importance for e.g.~security or interoperability.

It would therefore be an obvious
improvement to show links to sections that
update a given section. This cannot be done using normal in-line 
hyperlinks, as
issued RFCs may not be
modified~\cite{rfc-intro}, so
modifying a phrase to make a
smoothly worded inline hyperlink would be a copyright violation at
best~\cite{rfc-authoring}.  
One possibility is having an icon
(e.g.~``\emph{updated}'') as the link
source---this is not as
intrusive but the problem here is that a reader cannot know the nature
of the update, so following the link is essentially blind-folded
activity.  

One possibility, of course, is placing the links outside the text, in
the margin. This way, the text of the RFC remains untouched but
the link can state where it is going.
Figure \ref{fig-updatelinks} shows how such a
version could look. 
Creating a version such as this of all RFCs would be a monumental task
but would also save countless hours for later users.

% It is often tedious to try to find the right piece of information from RFCs
% due to their length and complexity. 
% Updates make the situation worse: even if the correct information is found,
% other RFCs have to be checked to see whether they change the XXX.

\begin{figure*}[htb!]
\centering
\fbox{
       \includegraphics[width=\mockupwidth]{demo4.ps}
}
\caption{A mock-up HTML version of a fragment of RFC 1034,
where the margin contains links to other RFCS that have been
published later and contain updates relevant to these locations in 
RFC 1034.
\label{fig-updatelinks}}
\end{figure*}

However, even here it is not immediately clear from the links what
the actual update in the updating RFC is. 
As Nielsen
states\cite{nielsen-links-as-microcontent},
links should be seen as microcontent, i.e.~an
ultra-short abstract of its target document. Thus, the users should
be made aware of what is at the other end of the link 
so that they can decide whether the linked-to document is
relevant to their current task.

The most unambiguous way is to simply display the complete
updating paragraph(s) from the updating RFC and vice versa.
Figure \ref{fig-updatelarge} shows the same fragment of RFC 1034 as before
in this type of display.
The problem with the page in Fig.~\ref{fig-updatelarge} is that the text of the
original RFC does not flow smoothly any more, since there is
too much updating information. 

Abstracting the nature of the update to fewer words is sometimes
possible but 1)~it would be an even more enormous task than simply
connecting the updating paragraphs for all currently used RFCs,
2)~the RFCs are already rather dense and it is not necessarily 
easy to find a good summary of the changes in a few words.

% Some of the above-mentioned problems can be solved by showing as much of the
% first updating paragraph as possible, with the constraints that the update
% must be centered to the updated paragraph and may not overlap with other
% updates. This is not much better, as it is less clear what is linked to what,
% and with cases such as the items 4.~and~5.\ of fig.~\ref{fig-updatelarge}
% there is no difference to the previously described clipping view.

In addition to showing the updates, 
it would also be desirable to show other
material related to the current paragraph from the same or other RFCs:
the RFCs contain a wealth of other intra- and intertextual structure
that would be useful for the reader to have at hand
in addition to the ``Updates'' relationship.

% such as a packet format or
% a command syntax.
% Readers not familiar with the subject
% would need definitions of terminology, and references to more obscure
% things such as the packet format is useful to any technical reader.
% Showing all this for every paragraph of the document is exteremly cumbersome,
% to say the least.

}
\caption{A mock-up HTML version of the same fragment as in Fig.~\ref{fig-updatelinks},
where the actual paragraphs from the other RFCs that update this RFC
have been included in the margin along with the links to give some more
context for the links.
The layout problems encountered by HTML are obvious.
Additionally, the browser is unable to animate the text quoted from the other
RFC to its new position on the screen when the reader follows the link to that 
RFC --- the text will jump, causing disorientation for the reader.
\label{fig-updatelarge}}
\end{figure*}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{FOCUS+CONTEXT VISUALIZATION}
%\ajk{Please review!  This will probably need a rewrite to make the
%  flow better.}
%\tjl{Should start more like the heading: one example of a more direct
%        view than a page-oriented scissor-clipped view}

%An interesting direct view is the class of presentation methods often
%called distortion-oriented, also known as the \emph{focus+context}
%technique.  Instead of showing the currently
%``interesting'' data on the screen and providing the viewer a way to
%switch the viewpoint --- for example by scrolling, or arranging the data into a browsable hierarchical structure, thus providing a way to
%zoom the viewpoint, so to speak ---  
%\tjl{Min‰ aloittaisini ensin
%  mainitsemalla distortion-oriented -jutun, sitten sen mist‰ siihen
%  tullaan.}
%focus+context views attempt to show an overview of the whole
%dataset while at the same time showing the details the viewer wants to
%see.  This usually scales better with the size of the dataset than
%simpler views that do not employ the distortion techniques.~\cite{fc-taxonomy}

Animation is a powerful tool for clarifying visualizations\cite{fc-taxonomy}.
Consider the view in Figure~\ref{fig-updatelarge}.
When the user clicks on the text in the margin
in order to move to the updating RFC,
the transition 
would be less disorienting if the parts of the text that are the same before
and after the transition were to be animated between the initial and final
conditions.

Level of detail is another useful device.
When the user is looking at Item 4 in Fig.~\ref{fig-updatelarge}, it
could be a good idea to show only the updating paragraphs related to 
that item fully and to shrink the level of detail of the updates
related to the other items to e.g.~showing only the headings. 

% Also, if there is enough room on the screen, it would be interesting to
% show more context: larger portions of the related documents, following more
% levels of connections and so on. 
% 
% On the other hand, since the update
% to the item 4.~in Fig.~\ref{fig-updatelarge} is so long, the neighbouring
% updates could be shown smaller when the user is looking at item 4.

Doing this in HTML is difficult or impossible due to the page model
of HTML (the next sections discuss why we exclude Javascript here).
When converting the RFCs into HTML, 
we are effectively printing (or manually writing)
the document and its relationships to other documents 
onto a virtual sheet of paper, the HTML page. Once on the page,
the amount of detail in the margin is fixed.
%However, as
As Ted Nelson puts it\cite{ted-oneliners}
%\begin{list}{}{\setlength{\leftmargin}{1cm}}
%\item[]

{\leftskip=0.7cm \rightskip=0.7cm
        Imitating paper on a computer screen ---
        as almost all consumer applications presently do ---
        is like tearing the wings off a 747 and using it as a bus on the highway. 
%\end{list}

} Since the reader is going to focus on one paragraph at a time
anyway, it would be much clearer to show that paragraph and 
the material related to it with more detail than the material
further away from the focus.
To do this we will have to
abandon the virtual paper model of HTML
in favor of the \emph{focus+context}
model\cite{fc-large-trees,fc-fisheye,fc-star}.

The fundamental ideas of focus+context were already expressed above:
showing what the viewer is focusing on with the
greatest amount of detail (usually enlarged in size)
and the rest of the material with less detail the further away
from the viewer's focus it is, and using animation when the user
changes the focus.
% To make more
% relevant data also more prominent, focus+context views typically vary
% magnification, level of detail and distance from the focus. This way the
% viewer can concentrate on the information, not on finding it.

A simple example of a focus+context view is
\emph{billowing}\cite{ted-billowing}, where 
a stream of text is shown so that the size of the letters is largest on the line
where the user's current focus (cursor, viewpoint) 
is, and the letters get smaller towards the edge of the window.  
Similar views can be found e.g.~in \cite{fc-fisheye} and \cite{fc-bifocal}
% It is
% similar to Furnas's Fisheye View~\cite{fc-fisheye} and Bifocal
% Display~\cite{fc-bifocal}.
%\tjl{Rather similar on outo}
and more advanced examples can be found from the areas of visualizing large
datasets, using hyperbolic trees \cite{fc-large-trees,fc-hyperbolic,fc-star}
and image browsing
\cite{fc-images}.  

%\tjl{Hyperdocument browsing - pit‰isi puhua
%  tarkemmin ja verrata meid‰n tyˆmme kanssa, vrt. Vesan nakki lopussa.
%  Koordinoi Vesan kanssa} \ajk{Vesa, selit‰ mik‰ se hyperdocument

% Animation and user interaction are an important part of focus+context
% views.  
% The user browses the data by moving the focus, 
% and animation is used to avoid disorienting jumps of the 
% focus\cite{fc-taxonomy}.

% show where the new focus comes from in the
% old context and where the old focus goes in the new context.
% Similarly, animation shows where other parts of the dataset shown move
% when the viewpoint moves..~\cite{fc-taxonomy}

% One can think of such views this way: The dataset is printed on a stretchable
% rubber sheet which is mounted on a rigid frame.  Whichever part of the dataset
% it is that the viewer wants to see, that part is stretched; this enlarges the
% data at the focus and makes the context seem smaller.  When the viewpoint is
% moved, the focus moves smoothly in this model, and this is usually simulated on
% the screen using all-pervasive animation.

One depiction of what a complete focus+context view of the RFCs
might look like
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-foccont-utopia}.
In this view, the user is shown many related paragraphs from different
documents at once, with the focus largest in the center.

\begin{figure*}[htb!]

\label{fig-foccont-utopia}
One possible focus+context view of the RFC 1034.  The original RFC is
in the middle, and related material, such as the pieces of the updating
RFCs, float around it.
The idea for the lines connecting the related parts is
taken from Nelson's early 
work on 
transpointing windows~\cite{as-we-will-think,ted-xanalogical-structure-needed}.
This view would of course be completely animated: when the user
clicks on a piece of text, that piece floats to the center.
}
\end{figure*}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{DESCRIPTIVE AND PRESENTATIONAL MARKUP\\AND THE VISUALIZATION OF HYPERDOCUMENTS}

In this section, we discuss the view proposed in the previous sections
and some issues in its implementation related to the 
relationship between presentational and descriptive markup.

In markup theory, 
the distinction between presentational and descriptive markup
is important (see e.g.~\cite{markup-systems-future-scholarly}).
Presentational markup expresses the way the document is supposed to look,
while descriptive markup describes the function of the
parts, e.g. the {\tt title} element in HTML.
Presentational markup generally ties the information it marks
up into a particular representation (e.g.~paper page),
which is why
information that is marked up in a descriptive way is 
generally easier to adapt to new visualizations and systems.

For document sets such as the RFCs where there are
important relations between parts of the different documents, 
HTML is only descriptive on the level of single documents.
Figure \ref{fig-hyperstructure-example} shows how the HTML 
visualizations in the previous sections use HTML as a presentational markup
language. 
The underlying simple hyperstructure has to be cut into
pieces (pages) and flattened
beforehand in order to create relatively complicated HTML
pages such as the one in Fig.~\ref{fig-updatelarge}.
The produced HTML files do not tell the browser that two copies
of the same text in different files actually do correspond to the same text in
the hyperstructure.
The fundamental ``Updates'' relationship between two pieces of text
has been lost in the conversion into low-level tabular formatting and 
point-to-point links between different HTML pages.

% A different, descriptive markup system could be able
% to describe the hyperstructure shown in 
% directly. An associated visualization system could then be able
% to show the structure with different visualizations.

% which could be described in a different markup system needs to be cut
% into pieces
% to obtain the view in Fig.~\ref{fig-updatelarge}: the latter view
% uses HTML as presentational markup for the connections, and the 
% true structure of the connections is not known by the browser..

% However, if we remain in the HTML model, it is not really possible to 
% implement these features in any simple way. 

% Also, when descriptive markup is used to create the documents,
% it is important that the full descriptive version be given to the reader's browser.
% Otherwise, the browser is given a particular presentationally marked-up version...


% and an associated visualization system which is able to use that
% descriptive markup to produce interesting visualizations is vital.

How converting the RFC hyperstructure to 
HTML pages makes the markup of the connections between 
documents presentational and not descriptive.
a) Three RFCs, with their structural relationships. A descriptive
        hyperstructural markup language would be able to directly
        represent this figure.
b) The resulting HTML pages, for visualizations such as
        Fig.~\ref{fig-updatelinks} and \ref{fig-updatelarge}.
  From these pages, the browser cannot 
identify the two different appearances of each letter with each other,
and cannot render the transitions from one page to another in a 
meaningful way. The link markup is presentational.
\label{fig-hyperstructure-example}}
\end{figure}

We pause to note that the same effect can be observed on countless
WWW pages, in the form of {\em navigation bars} where 
a set of HTML pages each show the same listing of pages at the same
hierarchical ``level'', with the current page highlighted. 
Here HTML is also being used as presentational markup and 
therefore the browser cannot easily show the set of pages 
in a more interesting user interface.

In order to express the actual hyperstructure in
Figure \ref{fig-hyperstructure-example},
a descriptive markup language
where bidirectional connections can be indicated
is necessary.
The W3C XLink proposal\cite{www-xlink-proposal} would
be able to represent the underlying hyperstructure 
of the RFC example properly.
Unfortunately, no implementations seem to exist.
Another alternative, which we discuss below
in Section ``A POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION'', is Ted Nelson's 
ZigZag\cite{zigzag-welcome}.

\subsection{Snapshots from a virtual reality: an analogy}

As an analogy, consider a 3D architectural model. 
One way of displaying it to the user is simply as a series of 
snapshots from inside it, with possibly anchors in them for selecting
the next shot. This is analogous to showing the RFC hyperstructure
to the user as a set of fixed HTML pages.
A more advanced way of showing the 3D architectural model is as a virtual
reality
walkthrough, where user can move around freely.
If there are some pre-specified viewpoints, the user's view
can fly through the space between them in a smooth way, causing
no disorientation by jumping from point to point.
This ability 
comes from the fact that
the virtual reality model contains the true structure of the 
underlying building, as opposed to just snapshots. The identities between
objects in different views are retained.

It could be said that the virtual reality viewer gives the user a more direct
view to the actual underlying structure as opposed to the indirect
view through the fixed snapshots.
It is possible to do the same for hypertext by creating
a more direct view of the underlying structure, such as a focus+context view
as discussed above.

% Figure \ref{fig-twomodes} shows schematically 
% the two different ways in which we can go from 
% a hyperstructure such as the RFCs and the Updates-relationships 
% onto the user's display, either indirectly via HTML page snapshots
% or directly by a program that directly traverses the hyperstructure.

% There is another important analogy between the virtual reality and hypertext
% examples. In the snapshot representation of the virtual reality world,
% the structure was flattened to images. These images, if too large, the user
% would then scroll like ordinary paper.
% Quite similarly, most HTML browsers simulate paper when displaying large
% pages to the user. For HTML, this is a reasonable option since the
% design of HTML is mostly concentrated on just that medium (except for
% some work on aural CSS\nakki{viite? Relevanttia?}), but with 
% a more intricate hyperstructure, as shown in \ref{fig-hyperstructure-example}
% a paper view is not reasonable any more.

% In the first alternative, the hyperstructure is first split into pages and
% flattened into HTML either manually or by e.g.~a program extracting data from a database.
% This HTML is sent over the network to the client machine.
% On the client, the browser then further flattens the
% HTML page into an image 
% on a virtual canvas, which the user can then scroll.

% \begin{figure}[htb!]

% \end{figure}



% Indeed, it is not necessary to be bound by the virtual paper paradigm.
% Modern computer displays have in the order of a million pixels,
% and the color of each pixel may be set individually at each moment
% in time. There is no requirement to use "pages".


% In Fig.XXX we saw how including too many
% \vp{ Screen is also a box. Think about ads in the magazines,
% they break the usual box layout. I'd say it is more about the box
% layouts than the paper itself.}
% \tjl{ I don't think so. Our system can also be used by box layouts.
%         The difference is that our boxes can move dynamically w.r.t. each
%         other, whereas HTML and paper simulators can't: the boxes are
%         frozen. We should make this point more clearly.}
% marginal notes in a document broke the flow.
% The flow was broken because all the marginal notes could not be properly
% fitted with the text into the virtual paper page.


\subsection{Using HTML as a presentational medium\\ for focus+context views}

Once we have the hyperstructure in Fig.~\ref{fig-hyperstructure-example}
marked up in a descriptive markup language, we can of course
generate HTML pages from that version using some kind of stylesheets.


When HTML is used in this way as the virtual paper, it does have
certain advantages: for instance,
it is a nearly universally supported,
well-specified\cite{html-spec} format.
Since virtual paper is
far cheaper than real paper, we can ``print" a virtual HTML page
for each focus separately.
\nakki{Rauli: enemm‰n pystysuuntaa kuviin!}

         Animation between these pages is not possible, and the arrow keys
         can't be used for navigation.
\label{fig-htmlfoccont}}
\end{figure*}

Unfortunately, this type of
focus+context content does not interact well with the common
HTML browsers:
for example, it is not possible to scroll the page up and down
using the usual paradigms of the browser. 
Also, since each new view would have to be fetched over the network,
the 
performance would be poor; if the browser were able to take advantage
of the descriptive representation, it would only need to be transferred
over the network once.

Using Javascript might also be one way of implementing focus+context
views but then, once again, the markup would be rather presentational.
The user would then be able to use one advanced interface to the data
but only one: the one written by the author of the pages.

% It is, of course, possible to express the underlying hyperstructure
% using HTML, using HTML anchors and links, and then to create a
% WWW browser that is able to show the structure around a document.

\section{A POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION}

\nakki{Make it clear that we do not say that cells are the representation
        we'd use finally, but spans, xanadu-type content links etc.}

We are currently working on a prototype implementation of the above
concept,
which we hope
to have completed in time for the final version of this paper, or
at least the conference.
This implementation, as 
most of our other work is based on
GZigZag,
\tjl{Cybertext yearbook-artikkeli ei ole viel‰ julkaistu, viittaus
        ei tiedossa}
which is an implementation of Ted Nelson's original ZigZag 
design\cite{zigzag-manual,zigzag-presentation,zigzag-welcome}
and is being developed in collaboration with him.

As with most of Nelson's work, ZigZag can be seen as several
different things depending on the point of view: a data\-base,
an operating system, a hypertext system, 
a personal information manager or
a wacky spreadsheet.
For the purposes of this article, it is probably best to
regard GZigZag (and thus ZigZag) as a toolkit for 
representing and editing hyperstructures and 
creating focus+context views into them.

% GZZ as a platform for making Fig.~\ref{fig-twomodes} b) easier!
% \nakki{Kirjoita!}
% Allows for transparent transfer of hyperstructure and simple Java code
% (later to be Clang) for structure \ra display!

The ZigZag structure is a simple way of representing data structures.
Information is divided into {\em cells}, which are connected
to each other along {\em dimensions}. The dimensions obey
physical-like rules: if cell A is "above" cell B, then cell B is "below"
cell A.
ZigZag allows for any number of dimensions to be used in the structure.
The data structure is fully persistent and in fact all the state
of GZigZag is currently stored in the ZigZag structure.
On restarting GZigZag after closing it down, all windows and focuses
are in exactly the same places as they were when the structure
was last saved.
This structure can be regarded as a general descriptive markup
language for hyperstructures, similar in scope to XML due to its
ability to represent any structure.

With the aid of the persistent structure,
GZigZag provides a simple framework 
for building focus+context views. The program code
to traverse the structure starting from the focus and
putting the cells onto the display is generally quite simple to write
(the technical detail is outside
the scope of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere).

Animation is used throughout the system to enhance the
visual connection between the subsequent displays --- the
system provides a framework for automatically including animation
into any new view programmed into the system.

% Another structure implemented in GZigZag in addition to the
% cell structure is the Xanadu media model. In this model, 

% but usually only a few are shown at a time.



% For example, Nelson's original row raster can be seen
% as a simple version of the view in Fig.~\ref{XXX}.
% \tjl{Can we nowadays do paragraphs in cells? Haven't checked
%         recently. I thought Benja had something like that.}
% \ajk{It has been possible to enter end-of-line characters into
%   cells for some time.  The edit view, at least, shows them
%   correctly.  I'm not sure if this is the paragraph point you talk about.}
% \tjl{No, I'm talking about having e.g. the row or vanishing view, with 
%   one paragraph per cell.  }
% \ajk{I'm not following at all.  Sounds like it's just a matter of interpretation
% and not of views.}
% \tjl{It's a matter of cellviews!}
% In the row raster, two dimensions are used, one vertically and
% one horizontally. The vertical dimension can be thought of as a stream
% and the horizontal rows show the connections between different streams
% (or parts of the same stream). Fig.~\ref{fig-rowraster} shows
% a structure simulating the "Updates" relation of RFCs and
% the focus+context motion through the documents.
% It is of course possible to show more context and use the human eye's
% perspective perception to great advantage: the same material viewed
% through the VanishingView is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-vanishing}.
% \vp{ Is this too similar to the row/col raster? How about something completely
% different ? }
% \tjl{ It's similar but it shows more. We should additionally
%         show something completely different, I agree on that one.
%         }

% \begin{figure}[htb!]
% \caption{
% \label{fig-rowraster}
% Nelson's original row raster.
% a) The ZZ structure used for this demonstration
% b) When the focus is at G, the stream 2 is shown, with connections
%    to streams 1 and 3 visible.
% c) Moving vertically does not change the appearance of the display radically
% d) Moving horizontally switches the stream. However, the connection between
%    the two horizontally connected cells remains.
% }
% \end{figure}
% 
% \begin{figure}[htb!]
% \caption{
% \label{fig-vanishing}
% The data in Fig.~\ref{fig-rowraster} shown in VanishingView, from
% three different foci.
% }
% \end{figure}

% For example, in Fig.~\ref{fig-rowraster} d), the horizontal motion
% causes the cells shown in both frames to smoothly animate
% to each other's positions. This effect makes moving around in the structure
% much easier because it is easier to maintain one's orientation.
% Similar ideas have been used in other focus+context visualizations,
% see e.g.~\cite{fc-hyperbolic}.

% \tjl{Find citation of text zooming in focus-context views! I've seen one.
%      Show a fragment of an RFC in billowing view}
% \vp{pad++ is a zooming interface, would that be even close
% to what you are looking for?}
% \tjl{No. A "less" analogue but which billows}
% \cat{Siis mik‰ pointti t‰ll‰ n‰kymien n‰in tarkalla esittelyll‰ on? Miten
% n‰in tarkka "general view"-juttujen esittely liittyy RTC-tapaukseenne?}
% \tjl{Eih‰n se ole tarkkaa. Pointti on, ett‰ noissa n‰kymiss‰
%         noi streamien v‰liset kytkenn‰t toimii samalla lailla kuin
%         niiss‰ kuvissa on mit‰ laitetaan}

% One special feature of GZigZag is that views can be easily added
% to the system, currently by coding one Java class.
% \cat{M‰‰rittele view? Termi ei ole sangen selv‰.}
% Therefore,
% the "painting" phase in Figure~\ref{fig-twomodes} is easily alterable
% on a per-application level even if all the user's data were stored
% in the same hyperstructure.
% \cat{En tajua.}
% Because the hyperstructural network of cells can be of any size,
% focus+context views are usually used: a particular cell is the focus
% of the user and cells either directly or indirectly closely connected
% to that cell are shown in some way.
% \tjl{Vesa said that Cat had a reference: a document should look like
%         the user wants it to look like}
% \vp{\cite{personalized}}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{RELATED WORK}

% Essentially, a focus+context browser uses the distorted view to
% show the viewer either a map of the set of documents being viewed or
% the one document being viewed in small pieces with one of the pieces in
% focus and the others as context, depending on the
% brower.

% There are several different types of focus+context visualizations of hypertext
% (mostly WWW). 

Most of the existing focus+context visualizations of hypertext 
focus on the topology of pages, mapping the
connections between different pages and some structural information of
the pages to either two- or three dimensional graphs or maps. Examples of
this type of visualizations are hyperbolic visualizations of large
hierarchies in \cite{fc-hyperbolic}, Natto \cite{fc-natto} and
hyperbolic visualization in three dimension in \cite{fc-3dhyperbolic}.
Some visualization show browsing history: for example WebPath
\cite{fc-webpath}, WebBook and WebForager \cite{fc-webbook} and
Zooming web browser \cite{fc-zooming}.
The VR-VIBE system\cite{fc-vrvibe} shows multiple WWW search 
query results to a 3D-space.

In addition to these,
there are some visualizations which show the contents of the web page in
a different way. The zoom web browser \cite{fc-zoom} and WEST
\cite{fc-west} show the web page as a set of cards with the
focused card bigger than the rest.

To our knowledge, all of the existing focus+context hypertext systems
are based on WWW and the HTML page model. 
\nakki{PROBLEMS!}


% Better in our system: real hyperstructure :-) We have easily
% modifiable views, bidirectional region-to-region links. We can show
% the interconnected information of hypertext better without the need
% for actively going to different pages to find related information. (
% Should mention something about the amount of information and
% links. And 404s in www. ) This system is closer to memex \cite{as-we-may-think}. 
% No page model! This system shows the content 
% better than others, other systems have boundaries in pages, they
% handle whole papers.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{CONCLUSIONS}

We have presented the Internet RFCs
as an example of a situation where HTML easily becomes presentational
instead of descriptive markup if the interrelations between
different RFCs need to be shown.
The underlying hyperstructure 
needs a different markup format for its description,
such as XLink\cite{www-xlink-proposal}  or ZigZag\cite{zigzag-welcome}.

A descriptive representation of information usually allows the information
to be used in more ways than a presentational representation does.
This is also the case here:
we have described an advanced visualization of the RFCs which is only
made possible
by representing the hyperstructure descriptively. 




% One of the advantages of HTML 
% \tjl{Important point we need to answer WELL}
% is of course that it is 
% relatively simple to produce without any programming experience,
% especially with current-generation WYSIWYG tools\cite{XXX}.
% This is one of the reasons for the explosive proliferation of the WWW.
