This is a short glossary of terminology related to GZigZag.
Only a short definition of each term is given, possibly with
a reference to more material on the subject.

<warn>

<hr>
<dl>
	<dt>ZigZag structure / space
	<dd>	A simple structure, based on <i>cells</i> and <i>dimensions</i>
		which the user is able to easily shape into any desired
		structure. All interrelated pieces of information can be
		close to each other on some dimension.
	<dt>cell
	<dd>	The smallest unit of information in ZigZag.
		A cell can contain a text string or 
		a single span in a permascroll; the separation is
		because a text string can be edited but a span can only
		be lengthened or shortened: no characters can be 
		inserted. Cells are connected to each other along
		dimensions.
	<dt>dimension
	<dd>	Connecting cells along dimensions is what ZigZag is
		about. Locally, dimensions work just like on a spreadsheet:
		each cell can be connected to one cell in the positive
		direction and to one cell in the negative direction 
		along each dimension. However, there are no global constraints
		between the dimensions.
		
	<dt>headcell
	<dd>	The negend of a rank, <em>or</em>, for
		circular ranks, a specially designated cell.
		If a rank of cells has one "special" cell, then
		it is usually the headcell.
		

	<dt>neighbour
	<dd>	Cells that are connected along a dimension are
		called each other's neighbours. Often, the term
		posward or negward is used with this term as in
		"the negward neighbour on d.cursor".

	<dt>posward/negward
	<dd>	In the positive/negative direction along a rank.

	<dt>posend/negend
	<dd>	As far as you can go negwards or poswards. 
		Circular ranks have no ends.


	<dt>rank
	<dd>	A rank on a dimension D is simply a set of cells that are
		connected to each other on D. A given cell can only
		be on one rank on a given dimension.

	<dt>raster
	<dd>	A set of cells selected from the structure
		by a set of rules, for visualization.
		For example, the row and column raster select,
		starting from the cursor,
		a single rank in one dimension
		an all ranks in another dimensions that 
		intersect that rank.
		The raster for the vanishing view selects all 
		cells within a given radius of the cursor.

	<dt>relcell, or relation cell
	<dd>	A cell which exists not for its content but for 
		expressing a relationship between other cells.
		For example, the cell between a father and mother
		in the family tree demo is a relcell.

	<dt>ringrank
	<dd>    A rank which loops.
		Ringranks still do have a specific headcell, specified
		somehow.

	<dt>row/column
	<dd>	These words simply correspond to ranks
		<em>being viewed</em> horizontally/vertically.
		They do not mean anything in the abstract structure,
		but only in the visualizations.

	<dt>view
	<dd>	A way of placing the cells in a particular
		raster on the screen.

	<dt>FloatingWorld
	<dd>	Ted Nelson's design built on top of ZigZag structure,
		based on <i>flobs</i>.
	<dt>flob
	<dd>	A multi-dimensional flying object. That is, an entity
		representing something that may have any number of 
		<i>flob coordinates</i>. For example, an email's sender is one
		flob coordinate, its subject another.

</dl>

	<dt>Xanadu88
	<dd>	A hypertext system, finished in 1988, which works by
		stable <i>fluid media</i> content instead of URL-like pointers.
	<dt>fluid media
	<dd>	Any media types that can be subdivided.
		Text, audio, video, images.
	<dt>permascroll
	<dd>	A storage philosophy for fluid media where
		each smallest unit (e.g. character of text)
		is assigned a permanent identifier when
		it first enters the system. Of course, 
		references to the smallest units usually happen
		through <i>span</i>s for efficiency.
	<dt>span
	<dd>	A (reference to a) contiguous section of the permascroll.
	<dt>vstream
	<dd>	A list of spans that describe a virtual stream of
	    	fluid media. A "document" or one version of a document.
		Modifying a document does not modify the permascroll, except
		by appending new inserted characters. Instead, the spans
		of the vstream are modified: split apart, new spans
		inserted etc.
	<dt>transclusion
	<dd>	The inclusion of the same material in a permascroll in 
	    	two different documents. One of the fundamentals of the Xanadu88
		model is that it is efficient to search for transclusions
		of a given span.
	<dt>transpointing windows
	<dd>	Windows on a computer screen that show the connections or 
		transclusions between each other.

	<dt>transcopyright
	<dd>	A copyright scheme where the copyright holder 
		grants the public a permission to refer to any
		portion of a given document and publishes the document
		in a permanent location.
		This way, anyone can quote the document by referring
		to it and the reader's browser will then go to the
		originator's server for the original material so that
		a micropayment can be made to the original author
		of the material.
