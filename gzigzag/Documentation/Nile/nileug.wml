	<p>
	Unlike most current word processors,
	Nile has several different modes.  
	This may seem complicated but the modes are fairly natural.
	The most commonly used modes are the character, word and
	sentence modes, through which the user can move with the 
	TAB key. In these modes, the following cursor keys apply:

	<!-- xtable (freetable) doesn't work with more than 10 rows
	 (yucks!). So we split... -->

	<xtable border=2 spacing=3>
	(=,1) colspan=2
		<b>Moving and hopping text</b>
	(+,1) 
	Left/Right
		(=, 2)
		Move the cursor
	(+,1)
	Shift-Left/Right
		(=, 2)
		Extend the cursor
	(+,1)
	Ctrl-Left/Right
		(=, 2)
		Shrink the cursor
	(+,1)
	Alt-Left/Right
		(=, 2)
		Hop the selected text

	</xtable>

	<xtable border=2 spacing=3> 
	(=,1) colspan=2
		<b>Deleting text</b>
	(+,1)
	Backspace
		(=, 2)
		Delete the previous unit.
	(+,1)
	Delete
		(=, 2)
		Delete the selected text.
	</xtable>

	<xtable border=2 spacing=3> 
	(=,1) colspan=2
		<b>Inserting text and changing modes</b>
	(+,1)
	[text]
