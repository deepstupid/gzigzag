Documenting how to start with GZigZag is difficult because it
is a moving target. So if there are any discrepancies with the
current CVS version and this document, please ask me (lukka@iki.fi)
to update it.
Especially the keystrokes are liable to change soon. This is the situation 
at the date given above.

When you first start GZigZag, you get two windows showing cells and
their connections.
The system works so that
you click on the right-hand window to focus on it and then all you need
is the keyboard: you can forget the mouse (it does work though: clicking
on a cell moves to it).

For the cursor motion you have the keys "IJL," and "ESFC". Pressing Tab
will give you a text insertion cursor that you can move sideways with the
arrow keys.

Other commands are n-<dir> for new cell, / (slash)-<dir> for connecting
two cells etc. They are shown in the user's guide.

Any other questions, just mail me.
