If there are any problems, read src/README.

What is gzigzag ? 
================= 

gzigzag is an implementation of the ZigZag(tm)* structure, which
was originally conceived by Ted Nelson. For more information about
ZigZag structure see Tuomas Lukka's 'A Gentle Introduction to Ted
Nelson's ZigZag Structure', which is included in the distribution as
Documentation/Gentle_Introduction. gzigzag was originally developed as a
student project in the Department of Mathematical Information Technology
at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland.

It has been agreed that the gzigzag name and distribution are under
the care of Ted Nelson, and are currently maintained for him by the
Jyväskylä group.

Documentation/   -- Documentation
src/             -- the new 0.8 tree


The old 0.6 tree: 

Java/            -- Java version, standalone and network client.  
Modules/	 -- Various modules for the Java gzigzag

C++/             -- The C++ standalone clientserver. OLD, NOT USEFUL ANY MORE
Perl/            -- Perl code for network. NOT YET FUNCTIONAL

Currently, the Java version is the one undergoing most development
and having the most functionality (much that is not found in the
C++ version). The C++ version has not been 
touched since the last millennium and the Perl code is waiting
to be tested with the updated Java code (as a TCP/IP cellserver).
