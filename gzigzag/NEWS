User-visible changes in GZigZag
===============================


CVS trunk
=========

Support for the old "PersistentDimSpace" file format has been removed.

The following new features have been added:
   - A preliminary ZigZag Transfer Protocol (ZTP) implementation
   - space dump and slurp functionality (for disaster recovery
     and format conversions)
   - accessing past versions of the space
   - a panic button
   - demo module: associative writing tool - a multilayered concept map
   - a -help option to the command line
   - a multiline cell view
   - support for cell-view specific bindings: when a cell view is associated
     with a cell in the structure (per d.cellview connection), in the cell
     edit mode bindings associated with that cellview can be used (so that
     content which isn't plain text can be edited easily)

The following features have been improved:
   - the user's guide
   - the multimedia module
   - the virtual community module

   - A prototype virtual community module


The 0.4 Series
==============

The following new features have been added:
   - A new UTF-8-based string scroll format (used in new scrolls;
